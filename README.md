# Neural Networks from scratch
Making a Neural Network with base python packages (numpy)

I will be following [Sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfzlCWGWYyIQ0aLC5w48gBQ) tutorial on making Neural Networks from scratch.

You can find the tutorial series [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo5dMEP_BbI&list=PLQVvvaa1QuDcjD5BAw2DxE6OF2tius3V3).

There exist a repo with more examples at [github/sentdex](https://github.com/Sentdex/NNfSiX/)
